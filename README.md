# Magic Wand Selector window:
this shows the original image. It gives you the ability to select an area like a magic wand tool. also, you can add separated area with "SHIFT_KEY + left button click", get threshold of the area with "ALT_KEY + left button click" or **you can custom cut a line shape selected area by pressing CTRL + left button click to the start point of cut line then again CTRL + left button click to the endpoint to cut a line selected area.**
 
# binary last mask  window: 
this window shows the current selected area like a binary mask to allow you to manage segments better.

# rgb final mask  window:
if you want to multi-segment an image you should pass to the "SelectionWindow" class a  parameter "class_color". then when you select the interest area to classify the segment you can set a label color to the segment by pressing the key value of your passed parameter "class_color" and you can see the results in this window. also, you can erase the segment area by holding the left button click
